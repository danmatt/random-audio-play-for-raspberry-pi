# Random-Audio-Player-for-Raspberry

This is my first attempt with python for the Raspberry Pi.

This little program plays audio files randomly out of a folder with a pause between plays. 
I will use it on an exhibition to play audio files.

I used the omxplayer. 

The music files schould be at /home/pi/music 
Works with mp3 and wav afaik
